# ML Model
## Disease Prediction from Symptoms

This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms, determining the appropriate specialist needed. Additionally, it provides recommendations for doctors based on their ratings, availability, and geographical location, enhancing the accessibility and quality of healthcare services.

### Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Multilayer Perceptron
- CatBoost
